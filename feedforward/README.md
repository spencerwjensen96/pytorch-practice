# Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model

The CBOW model is a type of word embedding technique used in natural language processing tasks. It aims to learn distributed representations of words based on their context in a given corpus. The model predicts a target word based on the surrounding context words.

```bash
cd cbow
python train.py
